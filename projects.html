                    <h1>Testing Setup</h1>
                    <p>
                        As pictured, three vibrating cylinders were mounted within a rail system located inside the wind tunnel. 
                        The oscillations were measured with a laser displacement sensor. The air speed within the vortex-shedding 
                        region was measured with a hotwire anemometer. Using FFT algorithms, the natural frequency of oscillations 
                        and vortex shedding were computed, allowing for comparisons to see if the cylinders were facing vortex-induced vibrations (VIV).

                    <p>
                        The downstream hotwire anemometer was calibrated using an additional master hotwire anemometer. 
                        Voltages were read at the downstream hotwire anemometer through a DAQ system. A 4<sup>th</sup> order polynomial 
                        fit was created to relate voltage to airspeed, allowing for precise airspeed measurements at a high sampling frequency.

                        A low-speed, open return style experimental wind tunnel was used to conduct the experiments. 
                        Featuring various layers of honeycomb flow straighteners, it generated uniform flow, allowing for accurate testing and measurement.

                    <h1>Airfoil Pressure Taps</h1>
                    <p>
                        A NACA 4412 airfoil with 18 pressure taps was tested at a Reynolds number of 2.5 Ã— 10<sup>5</sup> at various angles-of-attack. 
                        The pressure taps are distributed evenly, with 9 along the upper surface and 9 along the lower surface. 
                        Pressure coefficients were generated along the upper and lower surfaces, and numerical integration was used to generate the lift coefficients.

                    <p>
                        Values for lift coefficients were graphed, as seen in the image. 
                        The lift generated by the airfoil increased proportionally with the angle-of-attack up to 8 degrees. 
                        Above 8 degrees, the lift increases slightly as the airfoil is approaching its critical angle-of-attack at which the stall condition is reached.

                    <h1>Experimental and CFD Comparison</h1>
                    <p>
                        Using ANSYS Fluent, a 2D testing domain was generated around the NACA 4412 airfoil. 
                        The ambient conditions of the experimental test were matched, and a mesh was generated around the airfoil. 
                        Running the CFD simulation at the various angles of attack, a comparison graph was generated. 
                        As seen, the results from the CFD simulation disagree with our experimental results, 
                        likely due to improper conditioning and poor mesh refinement.

                        A rocket ignition device was designed, manufactured, and soldered. 
                        The device features a key switch and a red button. Following the insertion of the key, 
                        the device could be turned on and set to an armed position. From here, the pressing of 
                        the button would connect the circuit, allowing for a 9V battery to deliver current to our 
                        initiators, resulting in a small explosion that would light the rocket engine.
