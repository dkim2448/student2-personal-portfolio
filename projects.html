                    <h1>Hardware Loading and Disposal System</h1>
                    <p>
                        Designed and built an automated hardware loading system for the testing and 
                        validation of an Atlas Copco pulse tool. A linear rail moves a load cell test 
                        rig between stations that sequentially load a bolt, nut, and washer, apply 
                        torque from the pulse tool, and read clamping force. The system enables direct 
                        correlation between torque (from a torque spindle) and resulting clamping force 
                        across varying hardware types, sizes, and lubrication conditions. An automated 
                        disposal mechanism removes the used hardware after each test, allowing for 
                        continuous testing with a fresh set of hardware.

                        The downstream hotwire anemometer was calibrated using an additional master hotwire anemometer. 
                        Voltages were read at the downstream hotwire anemometer through a DAQ system. A 4<sup>th</sup> order polynomial 
                        fit was created to relate voltage to airspeed, allowing for precise airspeed measurements at a high sampling frequency.

                    <p>
                        As pictured, three vibrating cylinders were mounted within a rail system located inside the wind tunnel. 
                        The oscillations were measured with a laser displacement sensor. The air speed within the vortex-shedding 
                        region was measured with a hotwire anemometer. Using FFT algorithms, the natural frequency of oscillations 
                        and vortex shedding were computed, allowing for comparisons to see if the cylinders were facing vortex-induced vibrations (VIV).

                        A NACA 4412 airfoil with 18 pressure taps was tested at a Reynolds number of 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> at various angles-of-attack. 
                        The pressure taps are distributed evenly, with 9 along the upper surface and 9 along the lower surface. 
                        Pressure coefficients were generated along the upper and lower surfaces, and numerical integration was used to generate the lift coefficients.

                    <h1>2D Test Domain</h1>
                    <p>
                        A 2D C-type computational domain was created in ANSYS around the NACA 4412 airfoil. 
                        A structured mesh was created with edge sizing refinements utilized near the airfoil surface. 
                        The sizing refinements increase the accuracy of boundary layer behavior on the airfoil’s surface. 
                        The velocity inlet condition was applied to the top, bottom, and left surfaces of the domain. 
                        A pressure outlet condition was used on the right wall. The properties of air were modified 
                        to match the experimental values. To vary the angles of attack, the incoming flow direction was 
                        modified according to the angle, and the components of lift and drag force were decomposed using 
                        sine and cosine functions. This ensured the definitions of lift and drag stayed aligned with the 
                        direction of the freestream air.

                    <p>
                        The comparison plot was created by graphing the experimental and CFD data on Excel. 
                        As seen, the CFD and experimental results are similar, but do not match up exactly. 
                        At higher angles of attack, the CFD simulation underpredicts the lift coefficient 
                        when compared to the experimental data. This is likely due to limitations within 
                        the turbulence model used in ANSYS Fluent, which may not accurately capture the 
                        flow separation and stall onset. Additionally, the mesh resolution could play a factor in the differences seen.
